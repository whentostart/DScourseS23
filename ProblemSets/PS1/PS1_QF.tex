\section{Summary}



I’ve been interested in data science for quite a few years. Before joining OU, I worked for a public accounting firm. For Some projects, the financial data is massive and dirty. We were trained to use Power Query to manipulate data, but it didn’t function well. At that time, I generated the idea of learning data science, which could make my life easier. 

I completed a Python introductory course, which was a good starting point and brought me lots of fun. The first time I knew about the Data Science for Economists course was in Jack Wang’s summer paper presentation. Before my enrollment, I reviewed the course contents on Dr. Ransom’s GitHub, and I’m sure this course is exactly what I want to explore. 

Practice is the core of learning, and I’ll take this opportunity to apply what I learned from this course for my first-year summer paper. Specifically, my goal is not just fascinating my summer paper. What I want to develop and learn is a good habit of using smart tools and manipulating data. I believe that will benefit my whole career. 

Doing research and teaching is my dream after graduation.
